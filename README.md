PeakCET
=

2D peak detection algorithm called PeakCET is based on Contour Edge Tracking and mass spectra vectors clustering for fast and effective analysis of two-dimensional (2D) fingerprints. The algorithm starts by converting the raw file of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatographic (GCÃ—GC) into a pixel matrix, followed by contour edge tracking. In order to optimize the detection results in the presence of false negatives, mass spectra vectors of local maximum points within the contour are subjected to Affinity Propagation (AP) clustering.
